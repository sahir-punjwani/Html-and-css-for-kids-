# Html and css for kids

# Our plan
   children who does intrest in programing can learn basic HTML from this.
   
# Introduction
  To start you have to understand the Hyper Text Markup Language. The openingtags have (< and >) beside on them like you can see in starting.closing tags are like opening tags but has a slash like (</  >).

# Starting
  To start open docs and add a title "index.html". Next write<!doctype html> so browser will know what type of docs it is.Now add a openingtag and closingtag of html. In between of html's opening and closing tags add tags of head and below it tags of body.

# Going further
  In between the tags of body add the tags of h1 so you can write a heading. Remember there are 6 type of headings (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6).The size of headings decrease when number gets bigger. Next below the headings (h1) add the tags of p meant paragraph.
