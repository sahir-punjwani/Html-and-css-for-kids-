# Html and css for kids

# Our plan
   children who does intrest in programing can learn basic HTML from this.

# Starting
  To start open docs and add a title "index.html". Next write <!doctype html> so browser will know what type of docs it is.Now add a openingtag and closingtag of html (<html></html>).
